I am currently pursuing an Erasmus Mundus Joint Masterâ€™s in [Intelligent Field Robotic Systems](https://ifrosmaster.org/) at the Universitat de Girona, Spain, and the University of Zagreb, Croatia. My academic journey is driven by a passion for developing `autonomous robots` that can navigate and operate seamlessly in complex, dynamic environments.

Previously, I had the opportunity to work with [Dr. Michael Pantic](https://mpantic.com/) and [Dr. Lionel Ott](http://ott.ai/) at the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://asl.ethz.ch/), ETH Zurich, during my Robotics Student Fellowship. This experience deepened my expertise in autonomous systems and fueled my enthusiasm for cutting-edge robotics research.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Eastern Mediterranean University, North Cyprus, where my foundation in robotics and engineering was established.
